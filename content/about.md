I am an Istanbul transplant, living in NY for the past 20+ years.

I currently work at LinkedIn, managing teams focused on marketing solutions. For more information check out [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/buragc).

Outside of work, I love writing code for side projects and utilities I personally use, watch soccer, go on hikes, read, and cook as much as possible.
