I am a big fan of the [pomodoro technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) when the number of things I have to work on start exceeding 5\. The technique boils down to having a strict disciple of working for 25 minutes without any interruptions (yes, email and twitter count!) and then taking a small break immediately after. Creating chunks of works like this works for me since I can keep track of how far I am into finishing an activity. Today I came across [an article on Hacker News that has some tips for working remotely as a software developer](http://markcampbell.me/tutorial/2013/05/23/how-to-work-remotely.html). Here the author goes with a [timeboxed approach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing) and uses the pomodoro technique to get a lot more done especially when you don't have any outside stimuli that act as clues to stop working on a task.
