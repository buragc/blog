No, it's not an April's fool joke! My last day at EPAM Systems (NYSE: EPAM) was April 1st. I am starting a new position at Meetup.com as the Director of Core and Data Engineering.  

After spending 10+ years in creating solutions and leading teams in healthcare, I wanted to take on new challenges to broaden my horizons, learn more about a different industry and create solutions that help people in a different way. 

I am extremely excited about my new position. I am looking forward to posting more about our work at Meetup, our experiences in creating a large scale system and culture in the coming months.

Onwards and upwards.
