Conversational style UIs are gaining more popularity. In an era where people are living and breathing text messages and have an attention span for only nuggets of information,Â I foresee these conversational apps to become the norm.

I would even argue that as speech and video recognition gets more and more accurate, we will have these conversational apps morph into virtual assistants.
